 README GENERATOR 

## Description
---
I had to create a command line app, that generates a README.md file, which in turn would be calculated with questions  that I would input, using syntax, poplulated with specific markdown characteristics. It was expected of me, to include my github account, info such as my profile picture, email etc, all with the help of my api key, and a api call.
